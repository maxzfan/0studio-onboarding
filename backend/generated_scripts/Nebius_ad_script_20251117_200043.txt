Hey, so I just wanted to share something I've been using lately. I was struggling to find a good cloud solution, everything felt either too complicated or way too expensive, you know?

Then my friend told me about Nebius! Honestly, I was skeptical at first but their console is surprisingly easy to use, even for me! Plus, the pricing is super transparent which I really appreciate.

Seriously, if you're looking for a more straightforward and affordable cloud provider, you should definitely check them out. I think you’ll like them. It's nebius.com
